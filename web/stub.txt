1. Present Form to users
    - read a few static fields from DB, port of entry, air ports
2. Do front-end validation on most of the fields

3. Save the fields in a database and created a QR code with a URL referencing the id of the saved record
    - we never see the data through the QR code generated
4. Once the QR Code is read, we push the records for the id in the verification URL to DHIS2
    to create a TEI if they were entered within 24 hours back.
    - The pushing is done using Celery Tasks
5. As for the files (Vaccination Certificate and PCR Test Copy), we save them locally on the 
    File System and keep a path to respective file in the DB entry.
6. Using the TEI created, we can push images for the Cert and PCR test.
